In the 6 months I have had it, at no point has it been necessary to roll down the rear windows, so I really can¬¥t see the problem with the lack of bottons. The volume it controled at the steering wheel, but if you insist on using the bar under the screen, just slide it and it doesn¬¥t matter where you hit it. Same with the temp control."
19,Robert T,2023-03-10T03:54:08Z,2023-03-10T03:54:08Z,0,I heard VW discontinued software updates for many owners a while back.

23,Dionisio Ram√≠rez,2023-03-04T19:33:51Z,2023-03-04T19:45:48Z,20,"I have an European 2021 ID.4 with 3.0 Over The Air software. It works great now. It is a good car that, nevertheless, had several noticeable issues at the beginning. There are no software bugs anymore and, for example, Travel Assist works great now: it follows the road curves very accurately and the steering wheel turns smoothly (in this aspect, comparable to the Tesla SFD). After 1 year and 4 month I can say that the car is worth it."

25,Jarod John,2023-03-01T02:53:50Z,2023-03-01T02:53:50Z,1,"Have 33k miles on my 21 pro s and it&#39;s been an absolute nightmare. Worst car by far I&#39;ve owned. Suspension issues, ac control module failed from factory, faulty 12 v battery, and infotainment system is absolute garbage. I know there is a planned update, but my wife got it on hers and it&#39;s a very lack luster update. The current issue is there is a recall pending for a software bug that may cause lost of propulsion during driving. On top of all that seats are wearing out and cracking despite not using them, and a similar story on leather steering wheel starting to crack. While everyones dealer will be different but the two dealers in my area have been slow and frequently have to bring vehicle in multiple times before issues are actually fixed. Extremely poor ownership experience overall."

28,Chris Lamb,2023-02-28T00:57:28Z,2023-02-28T00:57:28Z,5,"I got one of these right before Christmas. I have 4450 miles on it and no software issues. Some things require more touches than they should, like changing stations on the radio, but not really the climate control. Just set it on auto and touch the ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù to raise and lower the temp. The travel assist works very well, once I‚Äôm on the highway, I don‚Äôt need to steer or work the pedals, and that‚Äôs with lots of curves and stop and go traffic. Where I live, teslas are extremely common, and I didn‚Äôt want the same thing as everyone else. You do give up is a little range, I have the awd and I only get about 265. It‚Äôs a good car if you want something different."

Every reviewer is always driving by themselves yet whining that they can&#39;t roll down the back windows easily... but why and who, when driving solo, needs to roll down the rear windows? I own an ID.4 and don&#39;t find it a bother at all. When my kids are in the car with me in the back, they can roll down the windows on their own."

You interact with it just too much for phones to be disconnecting, mileage to be that far off, OTA updates that don‚Äôt end up being OTA. <br><br>It‚Äôs clear VW is still over their head in this department, which is nuts considering how long they‚Äôve been doing this."

Smooth acceleration, nice handling and super quiet in the cabin. Build quality is excellent with no panel gaps or poor interior fit out. Apple Carplay and Android Auto have worked flawlessly. <br>That being said the UI isn&#39;t great. It has worked fine but it&#39;s just not very intuitive. If VW can come up with a UI that makes a little more sense then they have quite a car on their hands. All up we really love our ID.4."

44,Anthony Xuereb,2023-02-24T01:55:29Z,2023-02-24T01:55:29Z,2,Did the wet interior upset the electrics and is it better to simply plug in your phone for more reliable connectivity? In my car if I hold the button down long enough it closes<br>all the windows.

46,Open Format Videos,2023-02-23T23:55:17Z,2023-02-23T23:55:17Z,5,It‚Äôs very unfortunate that VW is so so bad at designing on the tech front. The window thing is annoying BUT there is a hack and you press and hold the rear window button and you can actually press one button to roll down all 4 windows. The audio issue isn‚Äôt a new thing either. Our old VW Tiguan would do that as well! We would have to play the radio to get audio to start and then open apple CarPlay and it would work after that. Not a new bug for them unfortunately

50,Mercedes BenzFW,2023-02-23T21:18:18Z,2023-02-23T21:18:18Z,1,Do the Carplay and Android Auto issues persist if you use the wired connection to connect or is it all through the wireless connection?
51,Mr. Nemo,2023-02-23T20:21:16Z,2023-02-23T20:21:16Z,1,Looks like VW didn&#39;t care about automotive reviewers&#39; and consumers&#39; feedback. They put the same crappy infotainment in the new Atlas and Crossport regardless even after saying they would change it for future models based on the ID4 backlash

53,warding12345,2023-02-23T20:04:48Z,2023-02-23T20:04:48Z,3,Android auto issues are most likely a google side issue if youve had it work before. Google pushes random updates that breaks things more than it fixes
54,Aussie2u,2023-02-23T19:50:53Z,2023-02-23T19:50:53Z,0,The ID4 is engineered terribly.  Watch MunroLive if you want to take a deep dive into all the shortcomings VW chose to take on this vehicle.
55,Mike.Macmyazka,2023-02-23T19:45:57Z,2023-02-23T19:45:57Z,0,In regards to the auto down feature with the windows‚Ä¶my 2016 Fusion SE with tech package has that and I did the same thing when I bought the car. Didn‚Äôt know it was enabled and must have had the key in my pocket while I napped. Woke up and wasn‚Äôt aware until the guy from my town‚Äôs city hall messaged me and told me. It was snowing that day.  Learned how to turn that off immediately and it‚Äôs been off since then. Probably handy down south when it is super hot but not in MN.
